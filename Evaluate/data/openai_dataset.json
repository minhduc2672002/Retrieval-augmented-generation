You spent the night in the mansion awaiting the safety of daybreak before venturing outside again.

A day later, while continuing your search, you heard screams coming from the town\u2019s church.

The vampires attacked the church and the priest inside it. You saved the priest from certain death and drove off the vampires, returning to the burgomaster\u2019s mansion to report what had happened. The next day, most of the townsfolk, along with many of the town guard, rose up in anger and marched on the Burgomaster\u2019s mansion in an effort to kill him. Your party intervened and convinced the mob to spare the burgomaster\u2019s life. In return, you gave them assurances that the burgomaster would never again rule and that Brick would instead become the town\u2019s burgomaster and eliminate all the festivals. when making this deal you also made a deal with the burgomaster telling him that you would spare his life and keep the townsfolk from lynching him as long as he assisted you in providing advice on ruling and the town\u2019s taxes and finances and such. Brick then decided to spend the next few days with the former burgomaster to learn from him and take over his duties. While he did this, Mort and a few others set off to investigate the strange fisherman who kept going to the lake and not returning with any fish. They discovered the man was under a strange trance and followed him to the lake where he then tried to get into a boat with a bundled-up girl. Freeing the girl from his clutches you then decided to take her to safety. She said that her father could be found at a Vistani camp near town.

Arizona's recent losses and lack of toughness are exposing vulnerabilities in their performance.","contexts":["Expert College Basketball Betting Advice: Vulnerable Top Teams","\nAs we head into conference play in college basketball, there are generally a team or a small group of teams in most conferences that are viewed as the clear favorites to win the conference. And the betting public is often pretty good at finding these winners. To keep things interesting, though, our goal here is to look at some of those top conference contenders to see which ones could be vulnerable and don't therefore offer as much value for bettors as some people might think. Here are four such giants that could hit a rough patch and be caught and passed by a conference rival. (Posted odds are odds to win the national title)","\nDuke (+400): 1.20 points per possession. That's what Boston College scored en route to their 89-84 upset win over Duke recently. There is only one way that a team scores at that kind of clip - they are playing against a team that is bad at playing defense. What has been striking since last year is that teams have no fear about shooting from beyond the arc against this Blue Devils team. They know they will get their chances, and they aren't afraid of throwing the ball up. The good teams that Duke has played this year all have done the same thing - throw up the three a noticeably significant number of times. And it's not like these Blue Devils are dominant inside, either. It can't be seen as too surprising that they struggle to defend. When you commit to high-end young talent like they have in recent years you can't make defense your first priority. If they can't tighten things up to a reasonable extent then they could be vulnerable in a conference that has some good teams. They may be the national favorites right now, but this is not yet a championship defense.","\nArizona (+1000): The Wildcats came into the season seemingly poised to be at least a No. 2 seed in the tournament and perhaps even better. In four days at Atlantis, though, the team's woes were really exposed. They lost three straight tournament games in the Battle 4 Atlantis - N.C. State, SMU and Purdue. There isn't a lot of embarrassment in any of those losses in isolation, but this team shouldn't be losing them and certainly shouldn't be in a situation where they are letting losses stack up. They beat themselves, and that is a real concern going forward. The Pac-12 is lousy this year, and that is a gift and a curse for this team. On the plus side, they should have a fairly sizable margin for error in conference play. On the other hand, even if they play perfect basketball their conference wins may not be enough to help the climb back into major contention for a high seed. I don't think that that is a major concern, though, because the toughness of this team - or lack of it - is an ongoing concern."],"ground_truth":"The vulnerable top teams in college basketball according to the context are Arizona, Kentucky, Gonzaga, and Duke."}

{"question":"What are some advantages of selling a home in the winter season?","answer":"Homes tend to sell more quickly in the winter due to low inventory and buyers wanting a faster buying process. Additionally, properties may sell at a slightly higher price in winter as agents are more motivated to price them correctly and buyers may be willing to pay more upfront due to fears of rising mortgage rates. Selling in late winter when there is less competition can also generate more interest compared to the saturated spring market.","contexts":["6. A faster home sale\nIt\u2019s counterintuitive but true: Homes actually sell more quickly in the winter months, even in cold-weather cities like Chicago, IL. There\u2019s no general consensus on exactly why this is true, although low inventory is quite likely a big part of it. Also? In winter, most people just don\u2019t want to slog through showing after showing. Instead, they want the buying process to be over and done with, and so they\u2019re more willing to pull the trigger.\n7. A higher listing price","5.

If you do have a winter open house, you\u2019ll also probably have more motivated visitors \u2014 there are very few window-shoppers during the cold-weather months, so you\u2019re not going to see your neighbor\u2019s son\u2019s friend meandering over to report back on your recent kitchen reno.\n6. A faster home sale","\nAnother surprise: Statistics show that homes actually sell at a slightly higher price in winter. This owes to several less mysterious factors. For starters, your real estate agent is going to be more adamant about pricing the property just right out of fear the home will languish on the market until spring. (If a property price reflects both the current market and the surrounding neighborhood, that home is more likely to go under agreement at a favorable price.) Motivated buyers might also submit a price that\u2019s too good to refuse. Finally, a fear of rising mortgage rates \u2014 rates tend to go up in the spring \u2014 might cause a buyer to be more willing to pay a higher price upfront. Whatever the reason, it\u2019s a happy discovery for many people who finalize a home sale when the weather outside is fright","\u201cThe general school of thought \u2014 and it most often proves to be correct \u2014 is that listing your home in the spring market will reap the biggest benefit,\u201d says salesperson Brad Malow of Douglas Elliman in New York, NY. \u201cBut late winter may actually be a prime time for coming to market as well.\u201d. And if your house is the only game in town, you\u2019re likely to have a lot more interest than in spring when the market is saturated."],"ground_truth":"Some advantages of selling a home in the winter season include the possibility of experiencing multiple-offer situations due to a shortage of desirable inventory, attracting first-quarter job relocators who often have credited moving expenses, having a more dedicated real estate agent due to fewer clients, less maintenance of outdoor spaces, fewer but more motivated open house visitors, faster home sales even in cold-weather cities, and potentially higher listing prices."}

GAL021's efficacy is predicted to be reduced at low ventilation levels and it displays a ceiling effect in reversing opioid-induced respiratory depression.","contexts":["Opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD) is a serious and potentially life-threatening complication of opioid overdose, abuse, and misuse. An option to avert OIRD is to treat patients on strong opioids with respiratory stimulants that do not interact with the opioid system and consequently do not compromise opioid analgesic efficacy. The BK-channel blocker GAL021 is a respiratory stimulant acting at K(+) -channels expressed on type 1 carotid body cells. The authors performed a population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) analysis on the ability of GAL021 to reverse alfentanil-induced respiratory depression in 12 male volunteers using an isohypercapnic experimental design.

Bikes too have played their part in this quest for speed and glory. Most super bikes are tuned and set for race standard. The idea is quite simple, hold the clutch, twist the throttle and hold on for dear life as the front-end lifts. This is best shown in the movie Biker Boyz. A story of biker clubs who rule street-racing. This kind of racing has come to our country. These races take place on abandoned roads far from prying eyes. A word of warning, do not for once think that you can do the same. This kind of street-racing is in fact illegal without the correct permits, licenses, protection and proper bikes or cars.","\nAs the cars evolved, so did the racing. We got to see Mustangs, Corvettes, Camaros, Dodge Charger, Pontiac GTOs, Chevelles, Plymouth Super-Birds, Hemi-Cudas and many more take to the streets and race for glory and prestige. To do the standing quarter-mile in under 10 seconds was the golden pinnacle for these racers. After that the world changed again. We got to see super-charged and turbo-charged racers come in from Japan. Nimble and with huge turbo-boosting, muscle cars had their noses put out of joint. You can see this in the movie Fast and Furious. The first one where Paul Walker goes toe-to-toe with Vin Diesel. A Toyota Supra goes head-to-head with a Dodge Charger R\/T. Tires squealing, we got treated to a race that made us reach the edge-of-our-seats.","\nThe world of drag racing has long fascinated us. Ever since we were kids, we wanted to go fast, go loud and be the first. Everyone has sometime or the other, just held on to the wheel and tried to go as fast as they can, just for bragging rights. The culture of drag racing started a long time ago. On the dry lake beds of California. The world was soon captivated with this concept. The world of V6s and V8s started to rumble and shout. As the sport grew, so did the fascination. Hollywood soon caught this bug and then showcased it in various movies. The idea is simple, just hold on to the steering wheel, keep your foot down, and just beat the other guy. After the Second World War, with the war economy booming, cars were cheap to obtain and also to race. In fact, in the movie Grease\u2019s set in the \u201950s, we got to see such a race. John Travolta and his gang tune up an old beater and turn her into Greased Lightening. Because that\u2019s how fast that car can go. You might be wondering how hard is it to go fast, anyone can do it. However you are mistaken, it takes skill, an innate knowledge of the mechanics of the car, the determination to find the ragged edge and the guts to ride it till the end. Sounds like fun, doesn\u2019t it? Remember, kids, don\u2019t try this at home.

{"question":"How does Netflix's recommendation system help connect unknown movies to their potential audience?","answer":"Netflix's recommendation system uses rich data to develop profiles and anticipate preferences, suggesting films based on individual tastes. By including unknown movies in its recommendation system, Netflix helps them reach their potential audience by matching them with viewers whose preferences align with the movie's profile. This approach has proven successful in promoting independent films like \"Nice Guys Sleep Alone,\" leading to increased visibility and opportunities for distribution.","contexts":["The article (not available online until Sept. 1) showcased the power of Netflix to connect unknown movies to actual movie theaters and explores the possibility that the company will expand its reach into actually producing independent films. But that's not what caught my eye -- rather, it was the story of how the company did a profit-sharing deal with the makers of a romantic comedy called Nice Guys Sleep Alone. Enter Neflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos, who told the film's director \"Send me 500 DVDs. Every time it rents, we'll pay you something.\"","\nWith rich data like that, the company can develop sophisticated profiles to anticipate preferences and tastes. \"It can tell you that you like The Godfather because you love family immigrant pics, and I liked it because I enjoy gangster flicks,\" Sarandos says. \"So the next film suggested to you will be Avalon, and the next one for me will be Scarface.\"In other words, had Blockbuster agreed to let Pollard put a copy of Nice Guys Sleep Alone on its vast video store shelves, the odds are slim that the film would have ever found its audience. Nobody had ever heard of the movie or Pollard, and unless its box randomly caught someone's eye, it would be doomed to gathering dust. But by being included in Netflix's recommendation system, anyone with tastes that matched the movie's profile found out about it.","\"An awful lot of people started renting this no-name title with zero marketing budget,\" (director Stu) Pollard says. \"As a result, it was picked up by HBO.\"The article doesn't really linger on this point, but to me it said something of fundamental importance about the future of all sorts of independent media. Because what Netflix has done for independent film is what the Web needs to do for independent comment: apply informatics techniques to connect content to its natural audience.","But Netflix is successful because it asks you to rate the movies you watch, and it learns from your preferences.

This theme is reflected in various instances where Jesus tells others to stay quiet about who he is, creating misunderstanding and confusion. The theme is seen throughout the Gospel in passages such as 1:25, 34, 44, 3:12, 5:19, 43, 7:36, 8:30, 9:9, and 16:7.","contexts":["\nFurthermore, Jesus\u2019 identity is a matter of some mystery.

Those who are on the \u201coutside\u201d (the demon-possessed, other Gentiles like that Roman soldier) do understand him.

They were your average young girls: they liked princesses and fairy tales, they spoke their minds, they loved candy and everything sweet, and they wanted to go on the most thrilling rides we could find. They talked and played and argued like sisters do, but the older one was particularly protective of her younger sister. For the oldest one, this instinct wasn\u2019t just a natural part of being sisters. It actually served a purpose. The oldest girl was used to protecting her younger sister for a number of reasons, but most notably because their home life was not the greatest. The reason the girls had come into my life was not the happiest of reasons. My mother had become their Guardian ad Litem, which means she has been assigned by the court system to look out for them. For whatever reason, the parents of the girls were caught up in legal battles, facing time in prison, drug charges, and a whole host of issues. My mother\u2019s job was simple: look out for the best interests of the children, and make sure they don\u2019t fall through the cracks. So she petitioned the judge for things like new clothes for school and doctor\u2019s visits, she gave her opinion on who the children should live with, and she established a positive and stable relationship with the girls so they would have someone to go to if needed.

David gave her one hundred dollars a month, which Lous parents gratefully accepted, asking no questions. They imagined that she made a great deal more money than she actually did, because she told them that she did. They had fanciful and unrealistic notions about the salary level of a roving reporter and Lou let them hang on to those notions.

{"question":"Where did the culture of drag racing originate?","answer":"The culture of drag racing originated on the dry lake beds of California.","contexts":["\nThe world of drag racing has long fascinated us. Ever since we were kids, we wanted to go fast, go loud and be the first. Everyone has sometime or the other, just held on to the wheel and tried to go as fast as they can, just for bragging rights. The culture of drag racing started a long time ago. On the dry lake beds of California. The world was soon captivated with this concept. The world of V6s and V8s started to rumble and shout. As the sport grew, so did the fascination. Hollywood soon caught this bug and then showcased it in various movies. The idea is simple, just hold on to the steering wheel, keep your foot down, and just beat the other guy. After the Second World War, with the war economy booming, cars were cheap to obtain and also to race. In fact, in the movie Grease\u2019s set in the \u201950s, we got to see such a race. John Travolta and his gang tune up an old beater and turn her into Greased Lightening. Because that\u2019s how fast that car can go. You might be wondering how hard is it to go fast, anyone can do it. However you are mistaken, it takes skill, an innate knowledge of the mechanics of the car, the determination to find the ragged edge and the guts to ride it till the end. Sounds like fun, doesn\u2019t it? Remember, kids, don\u2019t try this at home. Or you will have a tough time explaining to your mother why her car is stuck in a tree.","\nBy the way, if you think that drag racing is just devoted to cars, you are sorely mistaken. Bikes too have played their part in this quest for speed and glory. Most super bikes are tuned and set for race standard. The idea is quite simple, hold the clutch, twist the throttle and hold on for dear life as the front-end lifts. This is best shown in the movie Biker Boyz. A story of biker clubs who rule street-racing. This kind of racing has come to our country. These races take place on abandoned roads far from prying eyes. A word of warning, do not for once think that you can do the same. This kind of street-racing is in fact illegal without the correct permits, licenses, protection and proper bikes or cars.","\nAs the cars evolved, so did the racing. We got to see Mustangs, Corvettes, Camaros, Dodge Charger, Pontiac GTOs, Chevelles, Plymouth Super-Birds, Hemi-Cudas and many more take to the streets and race for glory and prestige. To do the standing quarter-mile in under 10 seconds was the golden pinnacle for these racers. After that the world changed again. We got to see super-charged and turbo-charged racers come in from Japan. Nimble and with huge turbo-boosting, muscle cars had their noses put out of joint. You can see this in the movie Fast and Furious. The first one where Paul Walker goes toe-to-toe with Vin Diesel. A Toyota Supra goes head-to-head with a Dodge Charger R\/T. Tires squealing, we got treated to a race that made us reach the edge-of-our-seats.","History"],"ground_truth":"The culture of drag racing started on the dry lake beds of California."}

{"question":"What is the difference between the work of Nostradamus and trendspotting according to Marian Salzman?","answer":"Nostradamus used tools like necromancy and astrology for prophesying, while trendspotting involves cultural scans and extensive research. Trendspotting is centered on copious legwork, both virtual and real, to identify cultural shifts and emerging patterns. Nostradamus is known for creating buzz with his prophecies, while trendspotters focus on analyzing current cultural trends.","contexts":["Go Easy on the Panic Button, Nostradamus\nPosted on January 8, 2018 by Marian Salzman\nOriginally published on HuffPost.\nAnybody who has been in the trends business as long as I have (nearly three decades) has mixed feelings about Nostradamus.","\nThere\u2019s respect for the fact that a French seer born in the boonies in 1503 is still creating buzz five centuries on. There\u2019s envy over his unearthly medieval toolkit, which included not just an actual crystal ball but also necromancy, astrology and a smattering of other Dumbledorean techniques.

{"question":"What was the primary goal of the partnership between The Oklahoma Association of Conservation Districts, Western Farmers Electric Cooperative, and The Oklahoma Conservation Commission in 2008?","answer":"The primary goal of the partnership was to develop and implement a carbon sequestration program that would benefit farmers and ranchers in Oklahoma while providing certainty to buyers. The partnership aimed to build a renewable portfolio for WFEC, verify carbon credits and practices by the OCC, and serve as an outreach and aggregation facilitator by OACD. The focus was on keeping the program local and offering something unique in the market.","contexts":["\nStarting in 2008, The Oklahoma Association of Conservation Districts (OACD, okconservation.org) entered into a first of its kind partnership with Western Farmers Electric Cooperative (WFEC) and The Oklahoma Conservation Commission (OCC) to develop and implement a carbon sequestration program that would benefit the farmers and ranchers of Oklahoma while providing an unparalleled level of certainty to our buyers. Because of a law passed more than 7 years before the launch of this project, the OCC had been given the statutory authority to verify \"carbon credits\" and practices resulting in carbon sequestration. With the possibility of a climate change bill being passed after the election in 2008, no matter the outcome, WFEC was looking to further build their renewable portfolio and the OCC along with OACD approached WFEC with the idea of a pilot project. WFEC would make the initial investment to pay for the credits, OACD would serve as the outreach and aggregation facilitator and OCC would embark on building their verification program.","\nBut in a state where topics like \"carbon credits\" and \"cap and trade\" were not only foreign but controversial, it was the group's focus to keep things local. Each of these three groups were locally led to their core. If WFEC was going to have to purchase credits to offset any emissions, they wanted to purchase as many credits as possible from the members of their own local electric cooperatives. And if the OCC was going to verify these practices generating the credits, then they were going to do so with the help and expertise of local conservation district employees and conservation commission employees alongside their federal partners at the Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS). And if this little program in Oklahoma was going to make any kind of an impression then we had to offer something that no other market at that time was offering. That's why we decided to make the commitment that every single contract that we signed would be verified every year by local folks that those farmers knew. In addition, WFEC made a large investment with Oklahoma State University's Soil Sciences department to determine actual sequestration rates based not on county-by-county boundaries, but on soil types and management practices to help bolster the program and its legitimacy.","\nSo we embarked on a project that had many of our own members scratching their heads. By the end of the enrollment period, however, we had over 50,000 acres under contract. Not only that, but the one county that has more acres than any other in the project is arguably the most politically conservative county in Oklahoma. To put that statement in perspective, this county with all these acres under contract was the only county in Oklahoma that Franklin D. Roosevelt did not win in 1936. In addition, the verification program that has been so meticulously built by the OCC and the participating conservation districts in Oklahoma has been recognized in international publications alongside some of the most commonly used carbon markets across the globe. That reception led us to build the ECOpass program.","\nThrough OACD and the ECOpass program we provide tours for groups or individuals who want to better understand today's agricultural system and farming practices. ECOpass is not just an intangible investment in a metric ton of carbon that you can never see, hold, smell, or touch. It is not a gimmick for those who don't believe that there isn't a carbon problem. It is a way to invest in your neighbor who is working every day to feed and clothe the world and doing it while protecting wildlife habitat, improving air and water quality, and going outside their realm of \"the way we've always done it\" to rebuild the health of the soil that has been stripped of organic matter through decades of hard farming. ECOpass is a way to invest in Oklahomans who are changing their ways in order to clean up and protect your water and protect the soil that each one of us depends on for our very lives."],"ground_truth":"The primary goal of the partnership was to develop and implement a carbon sequestration program that would benefit the farmers and ranchers of Oklahoma while providing an unparalleled level of certainty to their buyers."}

Essentially, the very fabric of space time continueum has been disrupted by a Spidey bad guy called Mysterio which sends ripples through the alternate realities of Spider-Man\u2019s world, affecting the \u201cAmazing Spider-Man\u201d universe, the \u201cUltimate Spider-Man\u201d universe, the \u201cNoir Spider-Man\u201d universe and the \u201c2099 Spider-Man\u201d universe and your friend, Madam Web, helps the 4 different Spidermen to put things right. Confused yet? To be honest, you tend to forget the story as they tell it because it\u2019s just boring and too complicated to remember really. But story isn\u2019t everything, right?","\nSpidey : SD is a very linear beat-em-up which came as a huge surprise to me since every other Spidey game has had some sort of free roam, open world feel to it. When you are a character who is largely defined by his mode of transport (web slinging), fans tend to want that ability but at most, you\u2019ll be using it to get over a hole that can not be jumped across. The game layout is done through a series of lengthy boss battles played out as entire levels. After completing a set of 4, another will unlock. You can\u2019t even just pick a universe and go from start to finish which really upset me because the four different universes play so differently and have their own pros and cons.","\nIn the \u201cUltimate Spider-Man\u201d universe, the game seems to switch into a more acrobatic and speedy fighting game. Strangely though, the lazy ass camera issues of the Amazing universe don\u2019t seem to exist in this dimension. The controls feel a bit tighter and you do feel more powerful as enemies tend to die a bit quicker at your hands in this particular game mode. The voice acting is quite good here too with the same voice actors involved with the Ultimate Spider-Man game from the PS2\/Gamecube days. The script for this section will make you laugh hard and generally you get the feeling that the makers do favour \u201cUltimate\u201d over \u201cAmazing\u201d.","\nIn the \u201cAmazing Spider-Man\u201d universe, gameplay is very similar to the God of War\/Wolverine style beat \u2019em up with the camera being too slow for the lightning quick attacks of the hero.

{"question":"Who was Stanley Meyer and what was his controversial invention?","answer":"Stanley Meyer was an engineer who claimed to have invented a method to power cars with water. However, his invention was met with skepticism as it was believed to violate the laws of thermodynamics. Meyer was later found guilty of fraud related to his invention.","contexts":["Inventor of the water-powered car screamed 'they poisoned me' as he died\nTwenty years ago, one of the most controversial engineers of the 20th century died under suspicious circumstances. Stanley Meyer, who was once hailed as a revolutionary innovator after apparently discovering a method which allowed cars to be powered with water, collapsed suddenly while dining with two Belgian investors who were interested in his work.","However, as any scientists out there will know, this would theoretically break the first and second laws of thermodynamics, as it allows for operation as a perpetual motion machine.\nWhat's more, during Meyer's patenting of his invention, he described the molecules in the engine as \"Fuel Cells\". This term is usually reserved for cells that produce electricity - not consume them, as Meyer's did.","During the trial, three expert witnesses found that there \"was nothing revolutionary about the cell at all and it was simply using conventional electrolysis,\" which eventually led to Meyer being found guilty of committing \"gross and egregious fraud\". As a result, he was ordered to repay a total of $50,000 to investors.\nEssentially, he was outed as a scammer.","Essentially, he was outed as a scammer.\nHowever, some people believe that the whole case was a cover-up, and that Meyer's method does work.

{"question":"What is the key instrument of choice in the area of Gurteen, Co. Sligo, as per the Coleman Heritage Centre's music archive?","answer":"The key instrument of choice in the area of Gurteen, Co. Sligo, as per the Coleman Heritage Centre's music archive is the fiddle.","contexts":["The Coleman Archive Volume 1: The Living Tradition\nColeman Heritage Centre CC5; 71 minutes; 2000\nSituated in Gurteen, Co. Sligo, the Coleman Heritage Centre has issued a\nnumber of compilation recordings synthesizing the essence of the county\u2019s musical\ntraditions (shared with neighbouring Leitrim and Roscommon). Prior releases\nhave consisted of new recordings, such as 1999's estimable The Mountain Road,\nwhich featured a large number of contemporary musicians, including the","\nEqually, there are few songs - just John Hannon\u2019s My Native Town of Boyle, Jim Murray\u2019s Maid of Sweet Gurteen and Fintan McDonagh\u2019s Collooney Town - while there is also little musical variation. Reels predominate, naturally followed by jigs, with just one slip jig and only one air (and, unusually, the latter played expressively on the mouth organ by Gerry Donagher), while there is not a single hornpipe. However, as Daly and Hernon argue, this should be taken as \u201ca true reflection of what existed in musical terms in the area, and any attempt to balance the material would be to interfere with this reality.\u201d A glance at recordings by older musicians from the Sligo\/Roscommon\/Leitrim axis does seem to verify this point. The McDonaghs of Ballinafad, for instance, includes just one polka and a single slip jig among a welter of jigs and reels. Fred Finn and Peter Horan\u2019s Music of Sligo features just one hornpipe. Leader\u2019s 1971 LP The Coleman Country Traditional Society is all jigs and reels, barring one slow air. The recordings of Michael Coleman and James Morrison offered far more variety, indeed Harry Bradshaw\u2019s compilation of the latter, The Professor, reveals a fiddler of remarkable versatility. However, both Coleman and Morrison were responding to the needs of both record labels and dance halls. One notable exception, as one would expect, is Josie McDermott, whose repertoire was extremely comprehensive, but then this reflected his extremely broad interest in music of many types.","Well, this reviewer is absolutely convinced that Johnny\u2019s toes would be a-tapping to this wonderful collection.\nThis review by Geoff Wallis was originally written for Musical Traditions \u2013.\nThis CD can be purchased directly from The Coleman Heritage Centre, Gurteen, Co.

{"question":"What was the purpose of the monthly newsletter produced by the Monadnock Folklore Society from November 1981 to February 1983?","answer":"The purpose of the monthly newsletter was to provide a regional folk calendar listing events at venues like the Folkway and Deacon Brodie\u2019s Tavern, showcase MFS performers such as Jean Redpath and George Winston, and include articles on topics like musician profiles, contra dancing, and Celtic lore.
